# Block Starter Kit
A boilerplate / starter kit for WordPress Editor (Gutenberg) blocks.

**Currently very much Work In Progress**

## Purpose
This starter kit aims to give a 'keep only what you need' approach to block building that works for PHP only WordPress plugins, Block driven plugins, or a mixure of both.

The kit is full of useful code snippets and tutorials. Every folder will contain a README.md file that will contain an explanation and a usage example.

It also contains serveral 'starter blocks' with plenty of inline documentation.

## Getting Started

- Download the plugin into your 'plugins' folder.
- cd into the folder
- run `composer install` to install PHPCS
- run `npm install` to install the project dependancies
- run `npm run build` to compile the plugin assets
